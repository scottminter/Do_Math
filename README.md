# Do Math

**A simple web app that performs rudimentary math calculations (both correctly and incorrectly)**

This app was written for the purpose of learning more about dependency injection, Laravel feature tests and unit tests.

To run locally:

-   run `php composer install`
-   make a copy of the .env.example and rename it .env
-   run `php artisan key:generate`
-   run `php artisan serve`
-   visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or the address provided by artisan when the local dev server was started)

To run tests:

-   run `php artisan test`
